\# TensorFlow Developer Specialization: Course 1, Week 2



Welcome to Week 2! This week, we're taking a significant step up from the simple "Hello World" of neural networks. We'll move beyond basic regression and dive into the exciting world of \*\*computer vision\*\* ðŸ§ . You'll learn how to build, train, and evaluate a neural network that can recognize different items of clothing and how to control the training process.

\## Part 1: Your First Computer Vision Model



This section covers the fundamentals of building an image classification model using the popular \*\*Fashion MNIST dataset\*\*.



\### Key Concepts ðŸ’¡



\* \*\*Loading Data\*\*: We start by loading the \*\*Fashion MNIST dataset\*\* directly from `tf.keras.datasets`. This dataset contains 70,000 grayscale images (28x28 pixels) of 10 different clothing items.

\* \*\*Data Preprocessing\*\*: A crucial step is \*\*normalization\*\*. You'll scale the image pixel values from their original range of `0-255` down to `0-1`. This helps the network learn more effectively.

\* \*\*Building the Model\*\*: We use the `tf.keras.Sequential` API to define our network architecture.

Â    \* `tf.keras.layers.Flatten()`: This layer transforms the 2D image (28x28) into a 1D array (784 elements), preparing it for the dense layers.

Â    \* `tf.keras.layers.Dense()`: These are the standard fully-connected neuron layers. We'll use the \*\*ReLU\*\* (`relu`) activation function for the hidden layer.

Â    \* \*\*Output Layer\*\*: The final `Dense` layer has 10 neurons (one for each clothing class) and uses the \*\*Softmax\*\* (`softmax`) activation function. Softmax converts the model's raw output into a probability distribution, showing how confident the model is for each class.

\* \*\*Compiling and Training\*\*:

Â    \* `model.compile()`: We configure the model for training by specifying an \*\*optimizer\*\* (`adam`), a \*\*loss function\*\* (`sparse\\\_categorical\\\_crossentropy`), and a \*\*metric\*\* to monitor (`accuracy`).

Â    \* `model.fit()`: This is where the magic happens! The model trains on the image data, learning the relationship between the images and their labels over several \*\*epochs\*\*.

\* \*\*Evaluation and Prediction\*\*:

Â    \* `model.evaluate()`: After training, we test the model's performance on a separate set of unseen images to see how well it generalizes.

Â    \* `model.predict()`: We use the trained model to make predictions on new images.

\## Part 2: Controlling Training with Callbacks



Training can sometimes take a long time. What if you could automatically stop it once your model reaches a desired level of accuracy? That's where \*\*callbacks\*\* come in.



\### Key Concepts ðŸ›‘



\* \*\*What is a Callback?\*\*: A callback is an object that can perform actions at various stages of training (e.g., at the start or end of an epoch).

\* \*\*Creating a Custom Callback\*\*: You'll learn to create your own callback by defining a class that inherits from `tf.keras.callbacks.Callback`.

\* \*\*Early Stopping\*\*: Inside your custom callback, you'll implement the `on\\\_epoch\\\_end()` method. This method allows you to check the training logs (like `loss` or `accuracy`) after each epoch.

\* \*\*Implementing the Logic\*\*: You'll write a simple `if` statement to check if your target metric has been met. If it has, you set `self.model.stop\\\_training = True`, and the training process halts gracefully. This saves time and can help prevent overfitting.

\## Exploration Exercises Summary



The code also includes several hands-on exercises designed to build your intuition about how neural networks work. Here are the key takeaways:



\* \*\*More Neurons\*\*: Increasing the number of neurons in a layer can improve accuracy but will also increase training time. It's a trade-off!

\* \*\*The `Flatten` Layer is Essential\*\*: Removing it will cause an error because the dense layers expect 1D data, not 2D images.

\* \*\*Output Layer Must Match Classes\*\*: The number of neurons in the final layer \*\*must\*\* equal the number of classes you are trying to predict (in this case, 10).

\* \*\*More Epochs vs. Overfitting\*\*: Training for more epochs can improve accuracy, but training for too long can lead to \*\*overfitting\*\*, where the model performs well on training data but poorly on new, unseen data. Callbacks can help with this!

\* \*\*Normalization is Key\*\*: Training without normalizing the data often results in a less effective model. Normalization helps the optimizer work more efficiently.



This week provides a solid foundation for all the computer vision tasks you'll tackle later in the specialization. Happy coding! ðŸŽ‰
