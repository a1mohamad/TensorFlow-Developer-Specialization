# TensorFlow Developer Specialization: Course 1, Week 2 Assignment

This document provides an overview of the graded assignment for Week 2 of the first course. The goal is to apply the concepts learned in the lectures to build and train an image classifier for the MNIST handwritten digit dataset.

## Assignment Objective ðŸŽ¯

The primary objective is to build a neural network that classifies handwritten digits (0-9) and to implement a custom callback that stops the training process automatically once the model's accuracy reaches a threshold of 98%.

This assignment will test your ability to:

* Define a neural network architecture for image classification.
* Create a custom callback class by inheriting from `tf.keras.callbacks.Callback`.
* Implement early stopping logic within the `on_epoch_end` method based on the accuracy metric.
* Integrate the model and callback to train efficiently.

## Assignment Breakdown

The assignment is divided into three main coding exercises.

### Part 1: `create_and_compile_model`

In this first step, you will define the architecture for your neural network.

* **Input**: The model should be prepared to accept 28x28 pixel grayscale images.
* **Layers**: You'll use a `tf.keras.Sequential` model, which includes:
    * A `Flatten` layer to convert the 2D images into a 1D array.
    * One or more `Dense` hidden layers with a `relu` activation function.
    * A final `Dense` output layer with 10 neurons (one for each digit, 0-9) and a `softmax` activation function to provide class probabilities.
* **Compilation**: The model is compiled for you with the `adam` optimizer, `sparse_categorical_crossentropy` loss function, and `accuracy` as the metric to track.

### Part 2: `EarlyStoppingCallback`

This is the core of the assignment. You will create a custom callback to control the training loop.

* **Class Definition**: You'll define a new class, `EarlyStoppingCallback`, that inherits from `tf.keras.callbacks.Callback`.
* **`on_epoch_end` Method**: The logic for early stopping goes inside this method. At the end of each epoch, it will:
    * Access the `logs` dictionary provided by Keras.
    * Check if the value for the 'accuracy' key is greater than or equal to 0.98.
    * If the condition is met, print the required message and set `self.model.stop_training = True` to halt the training process.

---

### Part 3: `train_mnist`

In the final function, you bring everything together to train the model.

* **Integration**: You will call your `create_and_compile_model` function to get a fresh, compiled model.
* **Training**: You will then call the `model.fit()` method, passing in:
    * The training images and labels.
    * The number of epochs (set to 10).
    * An instance of your `EarlyStoppingCallback` inside the `callbacks` list.
* **Return Value**: The function should return the `history` object generated by `model.fit()`.

## Success Criteria âœ…

Your solution will be considered successful if the training process stops before completing all 10 epochs and the message "Reached 98% accuracy so cancelling training!" is printed to the console. Good luck!
