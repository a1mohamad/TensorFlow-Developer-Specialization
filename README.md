## ðŸ“š Courses & Projects

The repository is organized by courses from the specialization:

1. **Intro to TensorFlow for AI, ML, and DL**  
   - Basics of TensorFlow and model building  
   - Data pipelines, datasets, and preprocessing  
   - Training simple neural networks

2. **Convolutional Neural Networks in TensorFlow**  
   - Image classification with CNNs  
   - Data augmentation and regularization techniques  
   - Transfer learning with pre-trained models

3. **Natural Language Processing in TensorFlow**  
   - Text preprocessing and tokenization  
   - Word embeddings and sequence models  
   - Sentiment analysis and text classification

4. **Time Series Forecasting in TensorFlow**  
   - Building RNNs and LSTMs for time series data  
   - Multi-step forecasting and evaluation  
   - Handling real-world datasets
